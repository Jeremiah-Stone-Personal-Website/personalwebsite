First project
The site has 3 pages with styling and an alert of "Hello World" from Javascript.
The first page or the home page has the mision statement, and a quote that describes me. Also a photo and links are in the header, that leads to the other pages, while the footer has links to socials.
Second page has info on myself from interests/hobbies, education and work experience.
Third page has info on projects I have worked on, hoping to fill that out and mkae that page bigger
